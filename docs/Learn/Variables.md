# Variables

In Iode, variables can have one of the following data types: **Int, Double, Bool, Char, String**.

Variables are mutable, which means they can always be changed.

```swift
var name:String = "John"
var running:Bool = true
var age:Int = 99
var pi:Double = 3.1415
var letter:Char = 'a'

name = "Billy"
```

For immutable variables, see *constants*.
