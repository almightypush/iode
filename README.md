a multi-paradigm, imperative, procedural, object-oriented programming language inspired by Swift & Ruby. It is free and open-source.

## goals

* fast
* easy to learn
* well-documented
* (mostly) object-oriented
* (barely) functional
* classes
* cross-platform
* javascript target
* self-hosting
* small

## another one?

> A language that really stood out to me in almost every way is Swift. Unfortunately, Swift is meant to run on only Apple machines running OS X or iOS. Upon seeing the code, I admired the syntax and design of the language. It was obviously *so close* to being the perfect programming language. I'm not trying to make the perfect programming language for everyone, I'm trying to make a good programming language that anyone can use and that everyone will love to use! :smiley:

## roadmap

- [x] lexer
- [ ] parser
- [ ] ast
- [ ] code generation (LLVM)
- [x] literals (bool, int, string, etc)
- [ ] statements (if, else, etc)
- [ ] functions & variables
- [ ] standard library
- [ ] import from c std
- [ ] first release

## thinking to contribute?

this project uses [llvm-d](https://github.com/Calrama/llvm-d/) for its LLVM bindings. For a to-do list of things that need to be done/fixed/implemented, [click here](https://trello.com/b/4o7ZAmRC/the-iode-programming-language). All help is much appreciated!
