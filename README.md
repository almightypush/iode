<h1>The Iode Programming Language</h1>
</div>

### Information

Currently, the Iode programming language is being rewritten. This compiler is being written in [D](http://dlang.org). In the future, this compiler will be replaced by a compiler written in Iode itself -- self-hosting! The compiler itself is being phased from using LLVM (thankfully, this is happening very early on!) to using it's own bytecode (or maybe C) generator, as well as a JavaScript target.

The following is a tentative list, very much subject to change, of things that need to be done for this project:

- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [ ] Bytecode gen
- [ ] JS gen
- [ ] Package manager
- [ ] Self-hosting
- [ ] Standard library
- [ ] A website
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Speed!
