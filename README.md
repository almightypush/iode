> A language that really stood out to me in almost every way is Swift. Unfortunately, Swift is meant to run on only Apple machines running OS X or iOS. Upon seeing the code, I admired the syntax and design of the language. It was obviously *so close* to being the perfect programming language. I'm not trying to make the perfect programming language for everyone, I'm trying to make a good programming language that anyone can use and that everyone will love to use! :)
