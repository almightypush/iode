# [![Iode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iode-lang/Graphics/master/Logos/Clean%2C%20Thin.png)](http://iode-lang.github.io/)++

Iode reimagined.

Iode is a multi-paradigm, imperative, procedural, object-oriented programming language inspired by Swift. The Iode project has 2 different, but similar main projects; `iode`, and `iode-js`. `iode-js` is extremely portable and compiles to JavaScript. `iode-js` is planned to be replaced by this repository, using [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten). However, `iode-js` will always be available in its current state. `iode` is written in C++ and is the main focus of the Iode project. Development for `iode` (codename `iode++`) started on **12/21/2015**.
